                opportunities to accomplish their dreams, creating a worth for future for the Youth of Garabito.</p>
                <p>Herradura Garabito is not about winning matches or training elite athletes, it about finding a common passion that is universal that bring people together regardless of race, religion, financial status, or education and can change lives for the better.</p>
            <h3>Objectives</h3>
                <p>For kids in developing countries, soccer is a tool, with education as the motivation to retain them. Without education being a cornerstone, retention is impossible. Herradura Garabito instills good communication, with honest and transparent relationships between parents and children of our community based on the values of respect and honesty that we impress upon the youth of our cantón.</p>
            <h3>Sports Objectives</h3>
                <p>Soccer is the vehicle we use to involve kids from all backgrounds. To help allow and promote our youth to compete in tournaments on the national, Central American and International levels. Creating well-rounded and professional athletes to represent our cantón and our country in the best possible manner. Facilitate the best implementation and education of the sport.</p>

            <h3>Maikel</h3>
            <p>For me, in my opinion, Garabito is a second family. We all respect each other no matter if they are from other places, if they are white, black, etc. We are a family, citizens and we respect each other.</p>
            <p>Deportivo Garabito teaches us values ​​respect humility love always happy to see the good side of things and never give up always head up and keep going because the word I can not do not exist are things of the mind that one puts oneself but in this team all that changes in this team everything is possible if you set out on this team every day we learn to be better people for when we are great people, respectful humble and kind. MANY THANKS SPORTS GARABITO.</p>

        <h3>Abraham</h3>
        <p>It is a good team where they teach us values ​​and personal teachings.</p>
        <p>Not only is it a soccer team, it is also a second family where a person is going through a bad time and given all the help.</p>
        <p>We have a coach who is not only a coach on the court, he is also a dad to many of the team.</p>
        <p>"TO GET TOGETHER IS THE PRINCIPLE, TO KEEP TOGETHER IS PROGRESS AND TO WORK TOGETHER IS THE SUCCESS"</p>

It provides a structured environment that instills self-discipline, builds self-confidence, and fosters quality relationships with peers and coach-mentors. We are a true partner in the community we serve. Because of our strategic collaborations with coach-mentors, parents, and community volunteers - we improve the well-being of youth and transform our cantón.  We truly need support to reach our goals for funding the organization along with travel expenses and sports equipment.
