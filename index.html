        <h3>The Ginger!</h3>
        <p>What is there to say? I'm a ginger. I'm also a veteran. Spent 7 years 11 months in the Navy as an AE. Basically I was an electrician on F-18's and MH53's. It was a blast. Went a lot of places. Have a ton of crazy memories. No regrets.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Before the service I was that guy who did a little of this and a little of that aimlessly for a few years. What I did that I loved the most though was help coach high school track at my old high school. Nothing quite as cool as passing down knowledge to youth and watching them grow into people with purpose.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here it is almost 4 years out of the service. I'm a lot fatter (crazy what happens when you aren't eating food from the boat galley) and grinding to get into this programming world. I've got some cards stacked against me. I'm 38 this year. Only scattered on again off again attempts at getting projects done and I, until recently, lived in an area so out there that 1.5mbps internet was the <strong><em>only</em></strong> option.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm done feeling sorry for myself for not making it yet. I've accepted that some past oportunities fell through. I'm making the sacrifices. I'm coding everyday. I'm letting this passion burn bright, I'm not going to temper it for anyone anymore.</p>

    <section id="Free Time" class="capstone-section">
        <h3>Free Time!</h3>
        <p>Dang, what free time? It seems like there is always something to do! I really enjoy manga and anime if I'm being completely honest. Kung Fu movies are a top priority as well. Marvel, star wars, you name it. Stories are enjoyable and I believe help keep the mind and imagination creative, in turn improving 'real life' problem solving abilities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When it comes to being outside, I'm a sucker for bass fishing. I enjoy fishing for various species, but just something about bass fishing specifically that I really enjoy. When I'm not fishing outdoor time is usually left to camping and walking my english bulldog.</p>

        <p>Which leads me to my most favorite free time activity; sitting outside as the sun goes down enjoying a couple drinks and just laughing it up and telling stories with family and friends. The world is a super busy place. It's easy to wake up one day and realize it's been years since you've seen a loved one. I find it important to enjoy the time you have with them when you can.</p>

    <section id="Aspirations" class="capstone-section">
        <h3>Aspirations!</h3>
        <p>I'm going to be a badass web developer. I refuse to compromise on that. I want to make creative and inspiring things. I want the next generation to see a website or app I've had a hand in and say to themselves,"I want to do that when I grow up".</p>
        <br>
        <p>More importantly I aspire to leave a legacy. I want my legacy to be an impact on the lives of those around me in ways that inspires them to impact the next generation and so on. I got a taste of this when I was an assistant track coach. Yes it was cool to teach them techniques and train them to improve their running specialty, but instilling a work ethic, moral values and standards, desire for more in life, an unbiased love for their fellow human, is just an incredible feeling. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I plan on using my passion and pure enjoyment of creating web pages to elevate myself to a position in life where I can not only teach and help others, but be in a financial position to go a step further and help create financial opportunities for those I'm helping who need that aspect as well.</p>
