        <h3>The Ginger!</h3>
        <p>What is there to say? I'm a ginger. I'm also a veteran. Spent 7 years 11 months in the Navy as an AE. Basically I was an electrician on F-18's and MH53's. It was a blast. Went a lot of places. Have a ton of crazy memories. No regrets.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Before the service I was that guy who did a little of this and a little of that aimlessly for a few years. What I did that I loved the most though was help coach high school track at my old high school. Nothing quite as cool as passing down knowledge to youth and watching them grow into people with purpose.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here it is almost 4 years out of the service. I'm a lot fatter (crazy what happens when you aren't eating food from the boat galley) and grinding to get into this programming world. I've got some cards stacked against me. I'm 38 this year. Only scattered on again off again attempts at getting projects done and I, until recently, lived in an area so out there that 1.5mbps internet was the <strong><em>only</em></strong> option.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm done feeling sorry for myself for not making it yet. I've accepted that some past oportunities fell through. I'm making the sacrifices. I'm coding everyday. I'm letting this passion burn bright, I'm not going to temper it for anyone anymore.</p>
